## Grade achieved: 85/100 (First)

### Site is live [here](https://s1802423-ct4009.uogs.co.uk/)

This is a group assignment to produce a website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.

## Pages

### Public

- [X] Home page
- [X] Login page
- [X] Registration page
- [X] Bike list page
- [X] Bike reporting stolen page
- [X] Bike registration page
- [X] Bike investigation (public)

### Police

- [X] Admin page
- [X] Bike investigation + reporting (split page JS)
- [X] Incident map page

## Scenario

The purpose of the project is to implement a website that will help Gloucestershire Constabulary to reduce bicycle theft. The website will also help Gloucestershire Constabulary to reduce number of Police Officers currently involved in investigating these crimes. Using the proposed system End-Users will register their bicycle to keep a record of frame number, bicycle image and other relevant manufacturers’ details of the bicycle. End-User will also report a stolen bicycle using the system.

## User Classes and Characteristics

1. Public
2. Police

_Public_ users can do the following using the website:

1. Public must register personal and login details
2. Public can login to the system
3. Public can register one or more bikes
4. Public can report a previously registered bike stolen
5. Public can check progress / status of investigation of a reported bike
6. The system will email out to victims re-assuring them of continued progress. These progress updates to the victim would also have a supportive role in line with corporate goals

_Police_ can do the following using the website:

1. An Admin Police can enrol other police officers, and create login details (user name and password) for them
2. Police officers can login to the system
3. Police officers can view a list of stolen bicycles reported in a specific week/ month/ year
4. Police officers can update investigation status of reported bicycles
5. The system will help Gloucestershire Constabulary to locate a stolen bicycle that has been advertised in an e-commerce website (eBay) for resale. A list will be shown including all positive search results
6. The system can be used to map victim locations (most vulnerable area) in a google map, so that the Police can support the areas that need extra Policing
7. View comparison of individual match (side by side display of victim’s item and the item advertised)

## The Report

Although practical, this assignment requires your team to submit full documentation and provide evidence of reflective review. Your documentation must explain all that you have done and confirm your technical competence. If you do not provide documented evidence and explanation for any aspect of your system, we will not be able to consider it when marking.

We will, however, randomly inspect various parts of your developed system to verify that what you discuss in your documentation has actually been implemented. Please ensure that we can access all aspects of your system. Your team will lose marks if we cannot verify that all developments are as discussed in your documentation.

- 80% of your mark will be allocated for the team’s submission as a whole, but you will receive a reduced mark if it is evident that you haven’t sufficiently contributed or engaged.
- 20% of your mark will be allocated for a personal statement.

The team's submission should include the following:

- The URL of your hosted web site.
- The URL, user name and password of your control panel.
- A table containing the list of functional and non-functional pages.
- Evidence that you have understood web technologies by showing interesting examples of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, Google map and eBay API code used in implemented pages.
- A concise User Manual targeted at the key users (website user and administrator). This should be task oriented and demonstrate good consideration of appropriate style. Relevant books on user manual style available from the Learning Centre include: “Read Me First”, and “Developing Quality Technical Information” – please use these.
- Documented evidence of the testing strategy you used to test the web site’s functionality throughout its development.
- Discuss business values of different features of your implemented web-site.
- Outline what security measures you have taken to implement the website.
- Reference List. Don’t forget that all code and ideas that are not your own must be fully acknowledged and used in accordance with any applicable restrictions. Use Harvard referencing
- Appendix 1: Screenshot of all implemented web pages.
- Appendix 2: All Source code (HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL database build code).

The total number of words of the team’s submission must not exceed 3000 words (for team of 2 students) or 4500 words (for team of 3 students). You will be penalised according to the Academic Regulations for Taught Provision if you exceed the size limit.

The team's submission must be written in third person.
You should carefully consider the following when writing your report:

- **Style** – suitable to be quickly read and comprehended.
- **Content** – relevant, clearly explained, logically organised.
- **Authority** – discussed concepts and ideas will need evidence in support.
- **Practical** understanding – your own practical examples, advice and demonstrations should be included.

## Personal Statement

Your personal statement should include the following:

- Explain how you contributed to the team; what tasks you worked on
- What you learned; and why you feel you contributed equitably to the team workload

The total number of words of the personal statement must not exceed 500 words. You will be penalised according to the Academic Regulations for Taught Provision if you exceed the size limit.

## Special Instructions

### Source Code

Submit your project source files on Web Server (student sites). The root folder should be named according to the convention:

```
CT4009 2019-20 002 StudentNumber1 StudentNumber2 StudentNumber3 SubmissionDeadline
```

For example:

```
CT4009 2019-20 002 1608131 1608133 1608135 18 May 2020
```

The website needs to be hosted on only one member’s Web Space (student sites)

### Team Report and Personal Statements

Submit report (just one Word document containing both team’s submission and personal statements) via Moodle named according to the convention:

```
CT4009 2019-20 002 StudentNumber1  StudentNumber2 StudentNumber3
```

For example:

```
CT4009 2019-20 002 1608131 1608133 1608135
